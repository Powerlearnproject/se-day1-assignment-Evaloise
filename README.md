#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
 SE is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.
IMPORTANCE
Enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
These include the development of programming languages such as Fortran, C, ADA
i)The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
ii)The advent of structured programming in the 1970s
iii)The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
4. Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5. Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
6. Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is the Sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall, e.g., requirements, design, implementation WHILE Agile is the Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1.Software Developer are responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
2.Quality Assurance Engineer - ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
3.Project Manager they oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. IDE's are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code for example Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
2. VCS are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
i. Changing Requirements
ii. Tight Deadlines
iii. Technical Debt
Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
i) Unit Testing this involves testing individual components or modules of software.
ii) Integration Testing involves testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
iii) System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
iv) Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Importance of Quality Control: Quality control measures such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the art of crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 
IMPORTANCE: It helps avoid confusing answers by making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need."

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective. FOR EXAMPLE 
Vague Prompt:
Write about animals.

Improved Prompt:
Write a 200-word description of the habitat, diet, and behavior of African elephants.
The improved prompt is more effective because it is specific, clear and concise
